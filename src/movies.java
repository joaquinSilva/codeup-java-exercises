//    Movie List
//
//    We are going to build an application that keeps track of movies and displays them by category.
//
//    Inside of src, create a directory named movies. Create all of the classes described below in this directory.
//    Create a class named Movie. It should have private fields for name and category, and a constructor that sets both of these. Create methods to access these properties and change them (getters and setters).
//    Download the MoviesArray file and save it as MoviesArray.java inside of movies. This class has a static method named findAll that will return an array of Movie objects.
//    Create a class named MoviesApplication that has a main method.
//    Give the user a list of options for viewing all the movies or viewing movies by category.
//    Use your Input class to get input from the user, and display information based on their choice. (Remember to import your Input class)
//    If a category is selected, only movies from that category should be displayed.
//    Your application should continue to run until the user chooses to exit.
